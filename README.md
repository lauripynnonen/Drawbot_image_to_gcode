# Drawbot_image_to_gcode_gui
Creates gcode for use on drawbots

This fork adds some basic GUI controls for Scott Coopers Death to Sharpie Image-to-GCode. 

The additions follow terrible coding practices and have no consistency in anything 
so don't use it with an empty stomach.

Thanks to Scotts original stuff it still kinda works
